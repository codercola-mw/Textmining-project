Abstract
This study is to explore how the features and characters are described among different
regions. And the next step is to create a model to classifiy wine region bases on the wine reviews. The project used TF-IDF vectorizer and Count vectorizer of 130k
samples from the top 10 regions to analysis adjectives and nouns in unigram dn
bigrams that are represented the characteries of the region. Statistical models as Navie
Bayes and Logistics Regression, as well as nueral netword model as Multilayer
Preceptron and Convolution Neural Networds, are used to classify region from the
tasting reviews. The result indicated that the unigram model has a higher performance
among all the classifiers to classifiy the region, and also the insights of wine features are extracted by comparing unigram and bigram models.
